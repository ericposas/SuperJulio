# Super Julio

  Mario-clone project, using Matter.js.. There will be violence 
  
  ### Known issues: 
    - When I added in the Goomba collision check/animation, it screwed up Julio's jumping 
    - Julio stops walking motion, if he reaches the scrolling boundary, but not touching a wall (will be solved when I switch to the background canvas rendering) 
  
  ### Need to do: 
    - Need to increment the speed in his run/walk cycle 
    
  ### Preloading 
    - Will use PreloadJS (CreateJS library) to preload assets
